This is a GitBook plugin to allow embedding a markdown inside a HTML block-level element.

## Example

TBD 


## How to embed block-level element

You can embed a new block-level element with the use of tag:

```
<!-- begin div -->

Insert markdown content here.

<!-- end div -->
```

A open-tag should be  `<!-- begin tag_name -->` and close-tag should be `<-- end tag_name-->`  . Attributes are processed as you wrote.
